Based on *current best practices and real industry trends*, here’s a **practical assessment of what features you should build now for MRU Merchant OS, and which should be planned as future enhancements**. This roadmap balances *what’s doable with your Supabase + Next.js + AI stack today* with *what is advanced, valuable, but better deferred* until your core is solid and traffic justifies it.

---

# 🚀 **Features to Build *Now*** — MVP / Early 1–3 Months

These are **high-impact, high-feasibility features** that align with current technical maturity and market expectations:

---

## 🔹 1) Easy Voice-First Store Creation (Foundational)

✔ Generate a simple digital storefront **from voice commands or quick prompts**
✔ Minimally formatted pages with products + “Buy on WhatsApp” buttons
✔ Support English + French for launch (later expandable to local dialects)

👉 This aligns with the *Shopify AI Store Builder idea* — using generative AI to auto-create store layouts + content from merchant input — simplified for your use case. ([Reuters][1])

**Why now?**
• Core value proposition
• Solves *friction point* immediately
• Builds storefronts without merchants needing to code

---

## 🔹 2) Voice-Based Transaction Logging & Feedback

✔ Accept audio via WhatsApp
✔ Convert to text via Whisper / STT
✔ Intent parsing (Sell, Restock, Balance) via LLM
✔ Confirmations back to the merchant

This is the core user experience differentiator — letting voice be the interface.
AI processing like transcription + intent extraction should be **live and responsive** from the start.

---

## 🔹 3) Supabase-Managed Backend & Authentication

✔ Merchant accounts with Supabase Auth
✔ Role permissions & profiles
✔ Secure webhook endpoints for WhatsApp responses

Following Supabase guided best practices ensures robustness. ([Supabase][2])

---

## 🔹 4) Mobile Money Integration (Payments & Float Tracking)

✔ MTN MoMo
✔ Orange Money

Even basic payment triggers and balance tracking early on greatly improves stickiness, since mobile money is your *real payment rail*.

---

## 🔹 5) Simplified Dashboard (Next.js + Tailwind)

✔ Basic sales view
✔ Mobile money float
✔ Inventory summary

This is core to merchant value — **usable insights without complexity**.

---

## 🔹 6) Basic AI Assistant for Navigation

✔ A simple AI chat interface (text + optional voice)
✔ Help merchants interpret and act on data (e.g., “Show yesterday’s sales”)

Generative AI here is not used for deep automation, but for guidance and discovery — *high value yet simple to implement*.

---

# ⚡ **Near-Term Enhancements (Phase 2)** — 3–6 Months

These are capabilities that *strengthen your product* but can wait until the core system is live:

---

## 🔹 7) Improved Template Library for Storefronts

Instead of *basic stores*, offer **pre-designed templates** you can auto-generate based on merchant type.

Inspired by Shopify’s AI Store Builder concept where merchants get multiple layout options from keywords + AI. ([Reuters][1])

---

## 🔹 8) Predictive Insights & Trend Cards

✔ Sales trend analysis
✔ Inventory alerts (AI-driven)
✔ Balance forecasting

These belong in a merchant dashboard — backed by analytics and AI insights (e.g., “You may run out of beans in 2 days”).

---

## 🔹 9) Recommender Engine Support

AI can begin to personalize suggestions — e.g., products to restock based on patterns, price optimization hints, etc. Recommender systems are standard in modern commerce platforms. ([Wikipedia][3])

This is not critical for initial launch but becomes strategically important as the user base grows.

---

## 🔹 10) Local Language STT + NLU Support

✔ Support Liberian Pidgin & Guinean French dialects

Though powerful, this is **resource-heavy** (needs fine-tuned models) and should come *after stability and usage data*. Implementation should be staged with careful ASR/LLM training.

---

# 🧠 **Advanced AI Roadmap (Future Enhancements)** — 6+ Months

These are powerful, but **complex, costly, or infrastructure-heavy**. Plan them after you have product traction, analytics maturity, and revenue runway.

---

## 🚀 11) Multi-Agent AI Workflows & Autonomous Actions

Inspired by *agentic commerce* trends — AI agents that can operate independently (search, negotiate, auto-order stock). ([Wikipedia][4])

This is forward-looking and powerful but requires:

✔ strong data layer
✔ secure AI orchestration
✔ policy guards (to prevent misuse)

Good *long-term horizon*.

---

## 🛍️ 12) Personalized AI Shopping Assistant

Full conversational AI that can provide recommendations, product discovery, and voice commerce — beyond basic voice logging. Models could suggest products based on merchant inventory + demand patterns. ([Insider][5])

---

## 🤖 13) Autonomous Float Rebalancing

AI that intelligently rebalances mobile money floats for agents automatically using predictive demand — more advanced fintech automation.

---

## 📊 14) Unified Customer Profile (AI-Driven CDP)

Once you have enough usage data, build a **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** that unifies merchant behavior across platforms and channels. ([Wikipedia][6])

This enables:

✔ personalized experiences
✔ retention automation
✔ advanced analytics

---

## 🧠 15) AI-Based Legal & Tax Optimization

Generate tax-compliant filings from voice + transactional history automatically — a *killer automation* — but can wait until the core ledger system is stable.

---

# 🧭 **Best Practice Logic for Prioritization**

Here’s the mental model to decide what to build now vs later:

**Immediately Valuable + Technically Feasible**
→ Done now

**Strategic + Adds Differentiation but technically heavier**
→ Phase 2

**Highly AI-Sophisticated / Autonomous / Advanced analytics**
→ Long-term future

This aligns with *current industry AI deployment patterns* — tools are already feasible for store creation and basic automation today, while agentic and autonomous commerce models are more future-focused. ([LinkedIn][7])

---

✔ Easy storefront creation
